So this is using SwiftUI. Just wanted to test it. 
Slightly have a problem with the Grid view. But the list is using Card. 

Task Details:
- Use any public RESTful API with a collection of movie info and movie posters. This data is needed to be displayed on the app.
- Create an iOS app that displays a page of movie titles and their posters.
- The app layout should be similar to the Pinterest app (refer to the screenshot).
- Implement pull-to-refresh on the list.
- When a list item is selected, present a new screen that shows simple data from the movie JSON object (such as the plot, director, and stars).
